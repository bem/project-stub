# Stub to start a new BEM project

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bem/project-stub.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bem/project-stub)

Project-stub is a template project repository used for BEM projects creation. It contains the minimal configuration files and folders you will need for quick start from scratch.

There are two main BEM libraries are linked here by default:

* [bem-core](https://en.bem.info/libs/bem-core/)
* [bem-components](https://en.bem.info/libs/bem-components/)

## Installation requirements

* [Node.js 4+](https://nodejs.org) is a platform built on JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications.
* [Git Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) if you use Windows OS.

**Note:** If your operating system is Windows, you must run the following commands in Git Bash with administrator rights. Make sure that you launch Git Bash as an administrator.

## Supported browsers

The list of supported browsers depends on the [bem-core](https://en.bem.info/libs/bem-core/current/#supported-browsers) and [bem-components](https://en.bem.info/libs/bem-components/current/#supported-browsers) library versions.

**Note:** Internet Explorer 8.0 is not supported by default. To support IE8 you must follow the [recomendations](https://en.bem.info/libs/bem-components/current/#support-for-internet-explorer-8).

## Installation

It's as easy as...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bem/project-stub.git --depth 1 my-bem-project
cd my-bem-project
npm install
```

**Note:** Do not use `root` rights to install `npm` dependencies.

## Usage

You could use [ENB](https://en.bem.info/toolbox/enb/) to build the project.

You can run `enb` commands via `./node_modules/.bin/enb`.

### Build the project

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/enb make
```
or
```bash
./node_modules/.bin/gulp
```

To be able to run commands without typing a full path to an executable file (`./node_modules/.bin/enb`), use:

```bash
export PATH=./node_modules/.bin:$PATH
```

Now you can use `enb` or `gulp` from any point of your project.

```bash
enb make
```
or

```bash
gulp
```

### The basic commands

Execute the following commands in your terminal.

#### Start the dev server

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/enb server
```

You could use the `npm start` command to start the `enb server` without specifying the full path to the `node_modules`.

```bash
npm start
```

The development server is running. To check it out, navigate to [http://localhost:8080/desktop.bundles/index/index.html](http://localhost:8080/desktop.bundles/index/index.html).

You may also specify different port if `8080` is already taken by some other service:

```bash
npm start -- --port=8181
```

#### Stop the server

Press `Ctrl` + `C` or `⌘` + `C` (for MAC devices) while the terminal is your active window to stop the server.

#### Add a block

If you want to use `bem-tools` to create new blocks, you should install additional dependencies:

```bash
npm i ym --save-dev
```

Now it's possible to create blocks with `bem create` command:

```bash
bem create new-block
```

#### Add a page

```bash
mkdir -p desktop.bundles/page
touch desktop.bundles/page/page.bemjson.js
```

And add following content:
```js
module.exports = {
    block: 'page',
    title: 'page',
    head: [
        { elem: 'css', url: 'page.min.css' }
    ],
    scripts: [{ elem: 'js', url: 'page.min.js' }],
    content: [
       {
           block: 'new-block',
           content: [
               'block content'
           ]
       }
    ]
};
```
